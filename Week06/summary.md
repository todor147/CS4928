Week 6 Refactoring Summary

Final Class Responsibilities

CheckoutService orchestrates the entire checkout process:
- Coordinates between all components
- Manages the checkout workflow
- No business logic - pure orchestration

ProductFactory builds products from recipes:
- Creates base products (ESP, LAT, CAP, AME)
- Applies decorators (SHOT, OAT, L, SYRUP)
- Returns configured Product objects

PricingService uses DiscountPolicy and TaxPolicy:
- Applies discount calculations via DiscountPolicy
- Calculates tax via TaxPolicy
- Returns PricingResult with subtotal, discount, tax, total

ReceiptPrinter formats output:
- Takes PricingResult and formats receipt string
- Handles discount display logic
- Produces identical output to original

PaymentStrategy handles payment I/O:
- CashPayment, CardPayment, WalletPayment implementations
- Each handles specific payment method
- Injected into CheckoutService

Design Principles

- No globals: All static state removed (TAX_PERCENT, LAST_DISCOUNT_CODE)
- Dependency injection: All dependencies passed via constructors
- SOLID compliance: Single responsibility, open/closed, dependency inversion
- Extensible: New discount types require only new DiscountPolicy implementation

Verification

Interactive Week6Demo proves behavior preservation - old smelly code and new clean code produce identical receipts.
